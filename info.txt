My Little Render Farm will set up and run a little render farm on AWS for a
single Blender project. You can choose the number and type of EC2 server instances
it will run on.

Normally your project will render to separate frames. Once all the frames have
been rendered My Little Render Farm will run a compositor blend file if instructed.
The default composite.blend simply joins all the frames together into a movie at the
project frame resolution size.  You can include your own compositor to take additional
steps if required.

You will need to have the following before getting started:

  * a basic understanding of AWS, including EC2, IAM, S3, CloudFormation
  * an AWS account
  * an AWS IAM identity with sufficient permissions to manage CloudFormation stacks
  * Python 3, pip and pipenv on your workstation

Create a copy of the included example/project.yaml and edit it to do what you want.
The example project is heavily annotated to explain exactly what it is doing.

By default the command line './farm -p myproject.yaml' will create and execute the render farm.

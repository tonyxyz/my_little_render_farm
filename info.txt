My Little Render Farm will set up and run a little render farm on AWS for a
single Blender project. You can choose the number and type of EC2 server instances
it will run on. By default it will stop each instance once it has done its job,
output is deposited in an S3 bucket.

Normally your project will render to separate frames. Once all the frames have
been rendered your can run the the included compose.blend file to create a movie
file or you can include your own composition blend file if needed.

The composition stage is not run if your project has a single frame.

You will need to have the following before getting started:

  * a basic understanding of AWS, including EC2, IAM, S3, CloudFormation
  * an AWS account
  * an AWS IAM identity with sufficient permissions to manage CloudFormation stacks
  * Python 3, pip and pipenv

Create a copy of the included example/project.yaml and edit it to do what you want.
The example project is heavily annotated to explain exactly what it is doing.

By default the command line './farm -p myproject.yaml' will create and execute the render farm.
